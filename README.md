# Celcius.Life

I built this app to have a reference when cooking and travelingâ€¦ and then found it to be a fun side project to tinker with.

## Install App

1. Visit https://celsius.life on mobile device.
2. Install as app:
    - iOS: choose "Install on Home Screen" from the share menu.
    - Android: open the action menu (three dots at the top right) and select "Add to Home screen".

Beta test the latest build: https://master--pensive-shockley-d7ccf2.netlify.com/

## Dev

This project was bootstrapped with TypeScript version of [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).
