# Celcius.Life

I built this app to have a reference when cooking and travelingâ€¦ and then found it to be a fun side project to tinker with.

## Install App

1. Visit https://celcius.life on mobile device.
2. On iOS, choose "Install on Home Screen" or on Android, open the menu at the top and select "Install App"

## Dev

This project was bootstrapped with TypeScript version of [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).
